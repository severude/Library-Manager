Great work on getting the Exceeds for this project! The code for all of the routes is clean, easy to read & understand. Nice use of Sequelize validation for all of the models. Your pug files all look good too. This is not an easy project to do & you've done a fantastic job with it! Keep up the great coding, only two more projects to go!
